## A little bit about me.

My name is Micah Matsunaga. I'm a fourth year OTM student in the Pamplin School of Business here at the University of Portland. I graduated high school in 2019 from Kauai High School on the island of Kauai in Hawai’i. Before you ask, no, I don’t know how to surf but I wish I had learned while I was younger (I have back problems now I’m getting too old). In my free time, I enjoy playing sports and a couple of the sports that I am still currently playing are Badminton, Pickleball, and Tennis. I also enjoy playing video games, some of which include titles that I would prefer not to mention in fear of public shame. I enrolled in this class because I enjoyed coding in a couple of other classes I took previously so I figured I would have some fun and learn something useful to my career path as well.
